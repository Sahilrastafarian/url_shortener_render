# url_shortener_render
A url shortener service using django

Used PostgreSQL to store the data

To short the bigger url's to small url's which are generated by django's backend using a uuid's first 6 characters. As uuid is
generated unique it can be used to map to the original url enterd by the user. If the generated uuid clashes with an older uuid
mapping to some other url server will try to generate a uuid again if it again clashes with some older uuid the server will 
respond with error message.

On successful shortening of the url the shortened url is sent back to the user and displayed to him/her. When user tries to access
this generated url the request comes on the server which extracts the last 6 characters of url and looks up the url to which this
unique 6 character key maps to and then server sends this url to clients browser with a status code of 301 to redirect him to the 
original url which was shortened at the start.
